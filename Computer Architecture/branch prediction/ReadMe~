To run the simulator:

First, extract the zip file to somewhere. Then, enter the path.

For static branch prediction simulator

	First, compile the simulator:
		gcc StaticBranchPrediction.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs glib-2.0` -o StaticBranchPrediction

	    (It maybe appears some warnings but it do not really matter.)
	    
	Second, execute the simulator:
		./StaticBranchPrediction <trace file name> <mode>
		
		mode type:taken, not_taken, profile

		For example,
		(1) Always taken, always not taken
			./StaticBranchPrediction data.txt taken
			or
			./StaticBranchPrediction data.txt not_taken

		(2) Profile guided prediction
			./StaticBranchPrediction data.txt profile

For two-level correlating predictor
	
	First, compile the simulator:
		javac TwoLevelPredictor.java
		
	Second, execute the simulator:
		java TwoLevelPredictor <trace file name> <number of bits>

		number of bits: 4, 8, 12, 16

		For example,
			java TwoLevelPredictor data.txt 8
